If you want your Hugo site to be featured in the **Showcase Section**, we would appreciate if you followed the guidelines outlined below.

In general:

* Create a copy of the `content/showcase/template` bundle with a suitable name.
* Adjust front matter meta data and write a story about your site
* Create a new PR in https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs/pulls


We want this to show Hugo in its best light, so **it must be notable to be considered.** So not the average Hugo blog; it needs to tell a story or the site owner must be notable...


## Files

index.md
: The main content file. Fill in the required front matter metadata and write your story.

bio.md
: A short summary of the website. Site credits (who built it) fits nicely here.

featured-template.png
: A screen shot of your website. It can be named anything, but the name must start with "featured". A size 1500 px wide is recommended with a 2:1 aspect ratio. The sample image is `1500x750`.


## "What should I write about?"

It should at some level is related to Hugo. It can even be self-promotional. Some suggested keywords:

* How the site was made.
* Why Hugo was chosen to build it.
* ...
